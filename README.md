US-American Indian treaty violations - Territorial confiscations

This project is an effort to answer the question, "What do you mean, 'stolen land'?" 
To answer that, this project will provide a Google Earth overlay that details the reductions to American Indian reservations starting with the creation of the United States, going all the way to the present day. The treaties included are from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_treaties#U.S.%E2%80%93Native_American_treaties).
